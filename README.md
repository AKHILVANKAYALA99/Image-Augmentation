# Image Data Augmentation for Deep Learning

## Abstract

Deep learning models require large amounts of annotated data for training to achieve optimal performance. However, obtaining such datasets can be challenging, especially for image-based tasks. The limited availability of annotated training data often leads to overfitting and poor generalization of deep learning models. To address this challenge, data augmentation techniques are commonly employed to increase the diversity and size of the training dataset.

This repository provides an implementation of various data augmentation techniques for image datasets used in deep learning applications. By applying transformations such as rotation, scaling, shearing, flipping, and color space transformations to the existing images, we can generate additional training samples. These augmented images help in enhancing the performance and robustness of deep learning models, enabling them to generalize better to unseen data.

## Introduction

This repository aims to address the issue of insufficient annotated training data in deep learning applications, particularly those involving images. We provide an implementation of commonly used data augmentation techniques to augment existing datasets, thereby increasing their diversity and size.

## Motivation

The performance of many machine learning and deep learning applications heavily relies on the quantity and quality of the training data. Insufficient data can negatively impact the performance of these applications, particularly when dealing with image datasets. To address this issue, data augmentation techniques are employed to generate additional training samples from existing data.

## Techniques Used

Our approach combines several commonly used data augmentation techniques, including:
- Rotation
- Scaling
- Shearing
- Flipping
- Color space transformations

These techniques help in increasing the diversity of the dataset, enabling the deep learning models to generalize better and improve their performance.
